# Stock-Market-Prediction-Using-Numerical-and-Textual-Analysis
This is a project, I have done under the Spark Foundation (TSF), I have used numerical and textual analysis to predict BSE Nifty stock prices. Leveraging libraries like TextBlob and VADER Sentiment, I downloaded and processed data, checked stationarity, and engineered features. This included rolling averages and date-based attributes. I also incorporated news headlines from Tribune, extracting subjectivity and polarity. Merging this with stock data, I built a predictive model using Random Forest Regressor, offering insights into stock price trends.
